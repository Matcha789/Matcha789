- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Zaleski
- 👀 I want to keep learning more about writing code, specifically how to get to a place where I am more confident in my skills. I am comfortable working in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js; but I do not feel like I am in a place where I can explain clearly how to communicate about the work. I an interested in getting to that place of coding confidence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about React.js, Figma, JEST, Vue.js, and Angular.
- 💞️ At the moment, I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I am a novice in this field, so I cannot be picky, but I do hope for a challenge to put me through the ring of fire to help me learn. I also want ot understand what it is like to collaborate with a team on a project, specifically I want to be able to bring a significant building block to a structure. 
- 📫 I am most excessable through my email and my linkin account.
